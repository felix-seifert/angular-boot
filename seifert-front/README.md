# seifert-front

This application should serve as the frontend for angular-boot which should serve as an intranet system.

By clicking on a facility name it is possible to see its details. Thus, two API requests are implemented: The request to get all facilities and to get the details of one facility. Additionally, authentification is needed. Automated testing does not happen.

The frontend is only developed every now and then and I am not that firm in Angular. However, you are welcomed joining me developing especially the frontend.
