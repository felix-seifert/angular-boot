# seifert-front

This application should serve as the frontend for angular-boot which should serve as a intranet system.

Till now, only one API to get all facilities is called. In a next step it should be possible getting the details of one facility by clicking on its name. Additionally, authentification is needed. Automated testing does not happen.

The frontend is only developed every now and then and I am not that firm in Angular. However, you are welcomed joining me developing especially the frontend.
