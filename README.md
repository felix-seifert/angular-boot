# angular-boot

This app is a combination of Angular as a frontend and Spring Boot as a backend; it should serve as an intranet system for multiple users. The backend provides the information via APIs (i.a. out of a MySQL database). The frontend calls these APIs.

I develop this only occasionally besides studying industrial engineering and management; I do this for trying out new things. Till now, only a snapshot of the backend is published. Besides realising testing, next steps would be implementing authentication and relationships with Hibernate.

So far, the technologies I used:
* Spring Boot
* JUnit 5
* Spring Data (with MySQL and Hibernate, H2 for testing)
* Lombok
